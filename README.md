Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) datasets are extensively used to analyze traffic accidents in order to improve the road safety and to design better accident prevention campaigns. This work is a case study of the FARS dataset for the year 2001, classifying the traffic accidents in function of the involved injury producing capacity. The challenges of this dataset are the mixture of categorical, real and integer features and the class disbalance, with almost four time of features for a class than the other. In order to respond to that problems then are applied 9 different classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Na√Øve-Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM linear, SVM with gaussian kernel, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Random Forest. Those models were combined with the class balancing algorithms Smote and ENN, in conjunction with a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection in a wrapper approach. The best model obtained an accuracy of 99.82%.
